# Dotfiles
###### Hunter Thueson
## Installation
1. Clone the repository into your home directory:
    $ cd
    $ git clone https://github.com/HunterThueson/dotfiles
2. Make the installation script executable *NOTE: This file doesn't exist yet, but it's on the TODO list.* :
    $ chmod +x ~/.setup
3. Run the installation script: *again, this doesn't work yet* 
    $ ./~/.setup
4. Follow the prompts. The script will take you through every step of the configuration process,
and will log everything verbosely in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/dotfiles-setup.log (defaults to $HOME/.cache/dotfiles-setup.log).

If you'd rather run just a portion of the script, it'll accept options on the command line.
The standard '-h' and '--help' options should give you enough information to get started,
but if you'd like a more in-depth understanding of the inner workings of the script, feel free
to check out the man page and/or the wiki here on Github. *again, please note, this script
doesn't actually exist yet, I'm just planning ahead by writing this, thx bb*

## Disclaimer
**This repository is nowhere near finished! It's gonna be great when it is,
but in the meantime, please don't blame me if you clone/copy the code and it
breaks something. I'm constantly breaking things on my own system at the moment,
and the contents of the entire repository are subject to change (or removal) at
any time without notice.**

That being said, if you do happen to find some of this useful, let me know! I'll
feel all warm and fuzzy inside. If you find a breaking bug, also let me know!
Maybe I'll fix it at some point. If you know how to fix it, please make a pull
request! I barely know what I'm doing half the time, and the other half I don't.
Any help or feedback is much appreciated.

Unless you're a dick about it, then I'll just ignore you, I guess, idk
